        <p>Bakar was born in London, England. He grew up his early childhood in Camden, North London.
            Bakar attended a local school for most of his early childhood. In his teen years he was sent
            to a boarding school in Surrey by his mother. He has descent from Yemen and Tazmania. He has
            spoke fondly of his time at boarding school as it allowed him to experience many different
            people from different places.</p>
        
        <p>Bakar grew up in London surrounded by musicians. However, he never necessarily saw himself taking the musician path.
            At this point, Bakar has been making music for about 6 years. He kind of stumbled opon his musical talent one year when
            most of his friends were on vacation. He was at home, ended up singing over a track and posting it anonymously on SoundCloud,
            and the rest is history.
