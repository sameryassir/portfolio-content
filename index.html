        <p>Bakar is a British singer, songwriter, and model. His full name is Abubakar Baker Shariff-Farr. 
            His genre of music is known to mix many genres together, but can be classified as indie rock. 
            <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/album/1AREUbGCrAwPHXsjjfeQ6d">His professional solo debut was titled "Badkid"</a>,
             and it released in 2018. He models for IMG model agency
        and is under contract with record label Black Butter.</p>

        <p>Bakar has described his music in the past as "schizophrenic". He has also said that he intends to
            "bridge the gap" between genres with his music. Bakar has only performed live a handful of times, due
            to much of his uptick in fans happening during the COVID-19 pandemic. His style has been noted as "progressive"
            when compared to other British rock.</p>
